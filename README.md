Poll It Off 
==========

PURPOSE
==========
This is a social media targeted app to receive and give opinions about anything through the use of polls. The app recommends people to share their thoughts and opinions openly, while respecting others at the same time and creating a safe environment. The main purpose is for fun and entertainment, and to open up new perspectives for people. This is done through the use of posting and answering polls, commenting and "liking" polls, interacting with other users. 

The main idea/theme of the app is simplicity. There will be three pages displaying recent polls, popular/trneding polls, and quickpolls. Quickpolls are polls that people want answered within a specific time frame, in which case they would use if they need a quick opinion on something, hence the name "quickpoll".
